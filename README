-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

This is a MacPerl build of Devel::DProf.  You need a recent MacPerl
(such as MacPerl 5.2.0r4, the latest as of this build) and either
the PPC MacPerl or the CFM68K MacPerl (because dynamic loading
is not avialable in the non-CFM 68K MacPerl).

You might also need to run autosplit:

    #!perl -w
    use AutoSplit;
    $dir = "$ENV{MACPERL}site_perl";
    autosplit("$dir:Devel:DProf.pm","$dir:auto",0,1,1);

Also recommended are Paul Schinder's Fixed Library Routines,
available from his web site:

    http://pobox.com/~schinder/MacPerl.html

This stuff is always available on CPAN and on pudge.net.

    http://pudge.net/macperl/

NOTES:

* Give a complete path to a script when using the MacPerl one-liner
  script:  C<perl -d:DProf 'Bird:MacPerl folder:myscript.plx'>

* This crashed for me under MPW.  I dunno why, and don't want to
  look into it now.  But just putting C<-d:DProf> on the #! line
  under the app works fine.

CHANGES:

I added <C#define XS_VERSION "19990108"> to DProf.xs.

The Devel::DProf package is a Perl code profiler.  This will collect
information on the execution time of a Perl script and of the subs in that
script.

The dprofpp tool is included in this package.

For more information consult the pod in DProf.pm.

Compatibility Notes (by Gurusamy Sarathy and Andreas König):
------------------------------------------------------------

DProf-19970614 will only work with 5.004 and above.  DProf-19970930
does work with 5.004 (stricly speaking), but it has a buggy testsuite
that will fail (correctly) on 5.004.

If you're using 5.003, you need to go back to the previous version on
CPAN (DProf-19960930).  DProf-19970606 and above will only work with
perl 5.004 and later.
